# Keeper App
This is a front-end part of a to-do app developed using React and a bit of Material UI. It was developed as part of the Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp. The exercise was not expanded on in any way.

Main features it has are:
- Ability to create and delete notes.
- Pleasant UI.

The goal of this exercise was to develop basic knowledge in React, which included the component design and states.
